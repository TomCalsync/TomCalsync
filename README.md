- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TomCalsync
- ðŸ‘€ I was directed here to report a problem with Outlook Google Calendar Sync which I have used successfully for many years.
- I just installed version 2.9.4.0 and I am no longer able to sync calendars in either direction.
- It appears that some of my settings may have been reset as I had to reset some of them but I do not have all my settings documented (my bad!).  So, it may just be a settings issue.  The error message I receive is:

You changed one of the recurrences of this item, and this instance no longer exists. Close any open items and try again.
If this keeps happening, please restart OGCS.
0 entries updated.

The documentation also asks for the OGcalsync.log file:

[OGcalsync.log](https://github.com/TomCalsync/TomCalsync/files/8628420/OGcalsync.log)
